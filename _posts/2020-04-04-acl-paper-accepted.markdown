Notre article de recherche *[Keyphrase Generation for Scientific Document
Retrieval](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.105.pdf)*, en collaboration avec Ygor Gallina et Akiko Aizawa a été accepté à
la conférence [ACL 2020](https://acl2020.org/).

**Résumé**:
Sequence-to-sequence models have lead to significant progress in keyphrase
generation, but it remains unknown whether they are reliable enough to be
beneficial for document retrieval. This study provides empirical evidence that
such models can significantly improve retrieval performance, and introduces a
new extrinsic evaluation framework that allows for a better understanding of the
limitations of keyphrase generation models. Using this framework, we point out
and discuss the difficulties encountered with supplementing documents with –not
present in text– keyphrases, and generalizing models across domains.
