Notre article de recherche *Large-Scale Evaluation of Keyphrase Extraction Models*, en collaboration avec Ygor Gallina et Béatrice Daille a été accepté à
la conférence [JCDL 2020](https://2020.jcdl.org/).

**Résumé**:
Keyphrase extraction models are usually evaluated under different, not directly comparable, experimental setups.
As a result, it remains unclear how well proposed models actually perform, and how they compare to each other.
In this work, we address this issue by presenting a systematic large-scale analysis of state-of-the-art keyphrase extraction models involving multiple benchmark datasets from various sources and domains.
Our main results reveal that state-of-the-art models are in fact still challenged by simple baselines on some datasets.
We also present new insights about the impact of using author- or reader-assigned keyphrases as a proxy for gold standard, and give recommendations for strong baselines and reliable benchmark datasets.
